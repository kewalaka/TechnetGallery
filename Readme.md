# Useful bits from Technet gallery 

Since Technet gallery is going away, this is to record anything useful that I remember about
and have used previously.

 * **DeviceManagment** - Device Management Powershell cmdlets
 * **PSWindowsUpdate** - The latest version published prior to it moving to compiled code
 * **Reset-WindowsUpdate.ps1** - The infamous reset script to fix all WSUS woes.
